>First off, thank you for considering contributing to spark-property-tests.

## Contributions
spark-property-tests is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into spark-property-tests itself.

## How
Create issues for any major bugs and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.

For **something that is bigger** than a one or two line fix:

- Create your own fork of the code
- Do the changes in your fork
- If you like the change and think the project could use it: 
  * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. 
  * Note the Code of Conduct. 
  * Raise a pull request.


## Avoid
Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Shoot an email to team.data-engineering@zeotap.com and we will be happy to answer you back.
